<h3 id="the-genesis">The Genesis</h3>
<p>I don't know if you feel like this, but at work you tend to be bored. So we all end up at the point where we want to make video games : </p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/SuperThevenin/superthevenin.github.io/blob/main/static/pictures/devblog1.jpg?raw=true" alt="idea picture" title="Idea Picture" /></p>
<p>So when the monotony hit us last December, we gave ourselves a little challenge with the idea of doing a gamejam. Because we missed the full night rush of a school project. You find yourself scrolling through <a href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a> between 24-hour gamejams and 6-month gamejams - there's so much choice! Here you'll find Jeremy's Idea of Capitalism, an entry for the Boss Rush game jam 2023. It's a boss rush where you play as a little robot on wheels, the game is so juicy no time to lose straight to the point. Furthermore the event is a small game jam with 124 entries. </p>
<p>We looked at each other and said “OK, that's it, let's go and take part in the 2024 edition !!!”</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/SuperThevenin/superthevenin.github.io/blob/main/static/pictures/bossrushlogo.png?raw=true" alt="boss rush logo" title="boss rush logo" /></p>
<h3 id="ideas-and-concepts">Ideas and Concepts</h3>
<p>Here we are, at the beginning of January in the process of making a boss fight game. In this specific game jam there is an plot twist and this year the theme was :</p>
<p><strong>Exchange</strong></p>
<p>Our first approach was to list all the ideas that we had about this theme. The goal of this was to put no limit on anything, it could be game-design, art or story idea. What we wanted was something that goes straight to the point and to have fun.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/SuperThevenin/superthevenin.github.io/blob/main/static/pictures/devlog4_1.jpg?raw=true" alt="white board with lot of post-it" title="white board with lot of post-it" /></p>
<p>A small list of the genius ideas we came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange ability with the boss</li>
<li>Exchange member of a team</li>
<li>Exchange positions</li>
<li>Exchanging perspectives</li>
<li>The trading market (it’s called exchange market)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-boss-we-want-to-make">What Boss we want to make ?</h3>
<p>To not totally go out of the bound, we wanted to see the state of the art by taking inspiration of games we enjoy.</p>
<p>Therefore, We went back to see a lot of different games and here is the list of what pop-up.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Elden Ring</strong></p>
<p>Fun, super difficult, main part of the gameplay is based on timing and prediction. The boss feel hug and overpowered. You need to learn the patterns of the boss to be able to defeat it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mario Galaxy</strong></p>
<p>The boss is based on one mechanic and the fun part is to found it. So, basically the boss fight is more like a puzzle to solve. It also a mechanics that you used before the level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The hand in Smash bross</strong></p>
<p>We would say that’s a bit of a mix between the two others, by adding the puzzle game with the attack and the fighting gameplay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="boss-features">Boss Features</h3>
<p>Then, with a lot of games played we end up extracting what we liked and what to avoid in a boss fight :</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid a PV tank which is just boring to kill, it’s more interesting when the damage are effective but hard to make</li>
<li>The most fun part of the boss battle is to understand the pattern and find a way to beat it</li>
<li>The boss have to feel over powerfull from the beginning, the player reaction should be “Oh shit ! What is that !”</li>
<li>The fight should be more and more epic until the final point where it goes crazy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/SuperThevenin/superthevenin.github.io/blob/main/static/pictures/devlog3.jpg?raw=true" alt="massive boss" title="massive boss" /></p>
<h3 id="the-final-idea">The Final Idea</h3>
<p>Couple of days have passed, it’s time to choose one of the ideas we listed and take it according on the time we have.</p>
<p>It’s our first 3D game, there is no need to go in full crazyness. Let’s keep it simple and follow the concept “exchange position ”. It will be probaby used in other games so we need to have our touch.</p>
<p>We decide to go on a third-person view from the top, with a exchange mechanic based on the character's ability to swap places with objects around him. For example, you can swap places with a rock to dodge the boss in order to cause him damage. </p>
<p>The goal would be to make a slightly large map with successive bosses. The control of the character would be done with the mouse, the A key for the exchange spell, mouse click melee to do damage and an open slot where you can retrieve contextual objects like weapons or items.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/SuperThevenin/superthevenin.github.io/blob/main/static/pictures/devlog2.jpg?raw=true" alt="swap rocks" title="swap rocks" /></p>
<p>Sounds good ? Like a league of legend but you have one spell and epic fight like hades.</p>
<p>True sounds really good at this time, we have 4 weeks to make something based on that.</p>
<p>I mean what could possibly go wrong ?</p>
